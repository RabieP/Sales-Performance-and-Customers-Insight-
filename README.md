## Overview

This project consists of **6 SQL scripts** that form a complete data analytics cycle:  
- setting up schema  
- stored procedures  
- executing procedures  
- basic analysis  
- advanced analysis  

The goal: to demonstrate how SQL can drive a real-world data workflow — from data ingestion and transformation to deriving actionable insights.

## Architecture & Workflow

1. **Schema and Table Creation**  
   Define core tables — `Customers`, `Products`, `Sales`, `Region`.  
   Handle renaming, foreign keys, and schema adjustments.

2. **Stored Procedures**  
   Modular procedures (insert / update / delete) to manage data operations.  
   Includes logic for computing derived fields (e.g. `Total_Amount`).

3. **Data Population / Execution**  
   Sample data inserts for customers, products, sales, regions.  
   Running stored procedures to simulate real data operations.

4. **Analysis Queries**  
   - Top products by sales volume  
   - Customer segmentation (age, gender)  
   - Purchase behavior and segmentation  
   - Regional trends, time-series (monthly / quarterly)  
   - Customer lifetime value, average order value  

5. **Advanced Analytics / Deep Dives**  
   - Ranking top customers by spend  
   - Month-over-month product growth  
   - Outlier detection (sales anomalies)

## Key Components

- **CTEs & Window Functions**  
  Used to rank, lag, average, detect duplicates, and segment data.

- **JOINs & Aggregations**  
  Core logic to link customers, products, and sales for insights.

- **Stored Procedures**  
  Encapsulate logic and make code reusable / modular.

- **Clean & Robust SQL**  
  Comments, formatting, and logical flow make it maintainable.

## Insights & Use Cases

- **Best-selling products**: Identify which SKUs drive the highest volume and revenue  
- **Customer segmentation**: Classify customers into value tiers based on behavior  
- **Regional trends**: See how different regions respond to different product categories  
- **Temporal analysis**: Monitor revenue by month / quarter and detect growth trends  
- **Anomaly detection**: Flag unusually high or low sales for further investigation

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a BI tool (e.g. Power BI / Tableau) to visualize insights  
- Automate pipeline with triggers or scheduled jobs  
- Add more advanced metrics: cohort retention, churn rate, forecasting  
- Improve error handling in stored procedures  
- Incorporate more complex joins (e.g. promotions, discounts)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the `.sql` scripts in a SQL Server environment  
3. Run `Table.sql` to create schema  
4. Run `StoredProcedures.sql` to set up procedures  
5. Run `StoredProcedureExecution.sql` to seed data  
6. Run `AnalysisQueries.sql` & `AdvancedAnalysis.sql` to explore insights
